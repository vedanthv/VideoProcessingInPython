## 👩‍💻Video Highlights Generation

### ❓ Problem being Tackled : 
The task of generating highlights for any sport is quite tedious and difficult. It involves a lot of tech and other software, hardware needs. You also need to invest in a lot of time to do it. If you’re into such a video company or department then it is okay, but if you’re a normal user just like me, you wouldn’t want to do it that way. 

We are going to use pure Python and some useful libraries to generate **high quality** highlights of a particular sport.

### ⚡ Our Solution
We will be using speech analysis for this task. Machine Learning and Deep Learning is also a solution but it will be added on in later iterations.
When something exciting happens during a game, there is a rise in the commentator’s voice. Let’s take cricket for example. Whenever a batsman hits a boundary or a bowler takes a wicket, there is a rise in the commentator’s voice. Both the audience and the commentators have high pitch during that event. We can use these changes in audio to capture interesting moments from a video.
