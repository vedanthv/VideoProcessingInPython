## 🏏Sports Match Highlights Generation

### ❓ Problem being Tackled : 
The task of generating highlights for any sport is quite tedious and difficult. It involves a lot of tech and other software, hardware needs. You also need to invest in a lot of time to do it. If you’re into such a video company or department then it is okay, but if you’re a normal user just like me, you wouldn’t want to do it that way. 

We are going to use pure Python and some useful libraries to generate **high quality** highlights of a particular sport.

### ⚡ Our Solution
We will be using speech analysis for this task. Machine Learning and Deep Learning is also a solution but it will be added on in later iterations.
When something exciting happens during a game, there is a rise in the commentator’s voice. Let’s take cricket for example. Whenever a batsman hits a boundary or a bowler takes a wicket, there is a rise in the commentator’s voice. Both the audience and the commentators have high pitch during that event. We can use these changes in audio to capture interesting moments from a video.

### 💡 Approach
▶ Input the video file <br><br>
▶ Extract the audio<br><br>
▶ Break the audio into chunks that can be analysed without excess compute power<br><br>
▶ Compute energy of every chunk of every chunk<br><br>
▶ Classify every chunk as excitement clip or not based on the sampling rate and threshold value<br><br>
▶ Merge all the clips to form the video highlights<br><br>
▶ Generate the final video highlights<br><br>

### 📷 Video Footage for the Project
The [video footage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18uSa-F8JMJHuE53FlKSuaQs1R2LWVvqg/view?usp=sharing) we are using is a 23 minutes clip of the cricket match between India and West Indies.<br>
In **Step 2** we are extracting the audio. Find the extracted `.wav` audio file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1820vX4kGLHhaKxVCUysPtmFUd8QCR7N7/view?usp=sharing)

### 👩‍💻 Codebase!
- To extract the audio file, here is the [code](https://github.com/vedanthv/VideoProcessingInPython/blob/main/HighlightsGeneration/AudioExtract.py)
- To divide the audio into chunks, classify as excitement and join all chunks here is the [code](https://github.com/vedanthv/VideoProcessingInPython/blob/main/HighlightsGeneration/AudioAnalysis.py) 

### 🏆Demo

## 📹YouTube Video Summarizer and Audio Generation
### Project Context

Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the Internet through out the day. It has become really difficult to spend time in watching such videos which may have a longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if we couldn't find relevant information out of it. Summarizing transcripts of such videos automatically allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and efforts to go through the whole content of the video.


This project will give us an opportunity to have hands on experience with state of the art NLP technique for abstractive text summarization.
### Implementation Details:
#### 1.Getting transcript for a given video
 We are going to utilize a python library youtube-transcript-api , which allows us to get the transcripts/subtitles for a given YouTube video. It also works for automatically generated subtitles, supports translating subtitles and it does not require a headless browser, like other selenium based solutions do!
#### 2.Performing text summarization
Text summarization is the task of shortening long pieces of text into a concise summary that preserves key information content and overall meaning.

In this project, we will use HuggingFace's transformers library in Python to perform abstractive text summarization on the transcript obtained previously.
The reason why we chose HuggingFace's Transformers as it provides us with thousands of pre-trained models not just for text summarization, but for a wide variety of NLP tasks, such as text classification, question answering, machine translation, text generation, chatbot, and more.
