# Now, I have divided the audio into chunks of 10 seconds each, since we want to find out whether a particular audio chunk contains a rise in the audio voice or not. You can set time limit as per your choice, Try different time limits for different outputs. Also, weâ€™ll play the audio chunk just for a check.

import IPython.display as ipd # for displaying audio file
import numpy as np

# loading the file with a sampling rate. Sampling rate is nothing but size of the chunks of audio librosa takes. This is default at 22,500 but I have taken it at 16,000 for better quality and also because my video isn't long.
x, sr = librosa.load(filename, sr=16000)
